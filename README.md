# Publication Metadata

This project is a series of scripts to parse our publications metadata for ingesters like Proquest (at least they're the ones that asked).

## Installation

This is a Ruby script and uses bundled gems.

* Clone the repo (`cd projects && git clone https://github.com/clirdlf/publications_metadata.git`)
* Install the required libraries (`cd publications_metadata && bundle`)

## Usage

* Run the `parser.rb` script (`ruby parser.rb`)

This will generate the appropriate CSV file to share with vendors.
